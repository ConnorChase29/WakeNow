###  Purpose and function of the application:

A helpful resource for people who hate waking up. The main feature of this application is an alarm clock that requires the user to type long enough to wake them. Individuals may add to do lists, words of encouragement, or start the day off right quotes. Whatever it takes for them to wake up! If the user fails to WakeNow, a bank of embarrassing Tweets are eagerly waiting to be posted to the user's account. Leaderboards for the most words typed, fastest typist, and many more statistics present a fun way to encourage the user to incorporate this application into their daily routine. This is not a simple alarm application, it is a solution to a global headache many have trouble dealing with - waking up.
